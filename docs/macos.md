# MacOS

Create a Symlink to the macOS Configuration File

```bash
ln -sf ~/Projects/dotfiles/.macos ~/.macos
```

Make the Script Executable

```bash
chmod +x ~/.macos
```

Run the Script

```bash
~/.macos
```

**Note**: The script will ask for administrator privileges since some settings require `sudo` access. You'll be prompted for your password.
